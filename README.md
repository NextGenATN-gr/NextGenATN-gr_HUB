Hub repo for project launch and co-ordination

## Project launch focus: **Epirus**

Epirus has a [rich history and tradition in mountain economy](http://www.vlachs.gr/en/the-vlachs-metropolis-and-diaspora/the-conditions-of-development) and encompases extensive lanscape, biodiversity and cultural and human capital resources. But it struggles as most rural regions across the world, even more so under the current Greek crisis. Nevertheless, our mountain landscapes are arguably one of our most under-utilised resources.

Adventure tourism however provides an enormous opportunity to grow, not just economically but also sustainably. The sector has seen robust growth globally of 65% yearly, even through the financial crisis, totalling 263Bn in 2016 and Europe is one of its key tourist markets  http://www.adventuretravelnews.com/new-adventure-tourism-report-reveals-263b-market-up-65-per-annum-since-2009. 

The ATTA defines a trip as “adventure travel” if it involves two of the following three elements, with the core of an adventure trip involving all three: 

- connection with nature
- interaction with culture
- a physical activity

The ATTA and UNWTO have already made huge strides in identifying, developing and promoting a models for sustainable adventure tourism based development. These initiatives provide great hope for a global, thriving, ethical and professional sector that can bring not just growth but a reinvigoration of culture and life in such areas, rewarding areas that have not benefited by industrialisation for effectively safe-keeping our landscapes, biodiversity and culture. initiatives have shown positive growth in many countries and are pushing onto the limits of what business can do alone.  http://youtu.be/PNafelPOaLs 

We don’t aim to compete or reinvent the great work these initiatives are doing. But we believe barriers to accessing the help exist for example the cost of membership or travel to summits. We want to reduce these costs to initial access of tools and resources by leveraging the innovation, community and capacity building power of open source and open leadership.

We are also well aware of visionary projects and leaders already carving the path for this in Greece. We hope to bring them together to help push against this open door and accelarate the charge.

# #DYIDevelopment - Do it ourselves - do it our way

To fill this gap we plan to leverage the power of working open. See this short video by Mark Surman, executive director of the Mozilla Foundation on the general principles of working open:

### OBJECTIVES:

OVERARCHING -> Promote sustainable adventure tourism in Greece. Fill the gaps where ATTA can’t reach.

- Set up an open source community to share examples, ideas, advice and resources.
- Reach out to experts from broad range of institutions and topics (ie for education to legal). Seek collaborations
- Provide training on open-source, crowd funding, maker and hacker space, digital skills, start ups? Engage local communities and national communities)
- Collaborate with the ATTA, UNWTO and other initiatives that can help with resources


### KEY PRINCIPLES
### 
- Open
- Sensitive to local but ultimately modern and global in appeal (This indeed how the mountain villages where my dad’s family survived thrived as cultural and economic centres throughout the times of the ottoman empire! 
- Participatory
- Collaborative


### TOPICS

- wilderness vs scale
