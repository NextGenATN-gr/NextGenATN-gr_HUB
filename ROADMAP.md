## Aug 2017 - The Tour!

I am extremely escited to be planning a tour of the Epirus mountains and I hope to start meeting people in person. It will be a great opportunity to discuss the launch event in person.

Got something I should check out? Let me know and I'll see if I can schedule a stop!

Also, adventure mates always welcome!



## 2018 - Launch Event in Epirus

The details of this event are still wide open and will be the focus of much of the consultation. Key areas of preparation are:

1. FUNDING
    We will need funcding to cover the costs of a launch event and we are open to exploring both traditional all more modern routes (eg crowdsourcing). Got expertise in this area? Please get in touch!
    - location
    - travel grants for attendees
    

2. LEADERS
    - A key aspect of the initiative is leading by example and capacity building and mentorship through the network
